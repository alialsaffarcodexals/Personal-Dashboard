# Personal Dashboard

A simple multi‑page personal dashboard built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Each tool lives on its own page and works entirely in the browser.

## Pages
- **Tasks** – add, edit, delete and complete to‑dos. Tasks persist with `localStorage`.
- **Notes** – jot down notes and save them locally.
- **Calendar** – interactive monthly calendar with previous/next navigation and today highlighted.
- **Weather** – enter a city to fetch the current temperature using the free Open‑Meteo API.
- **Quotes** – pull a random inspirational quote from the Quotable API.

## Setup
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser to access links to all tools.
3. No build step or backend is required. Weather and quotes pages require an internet connection for API calls.

## Development
The project has no automated tests at the moment.
